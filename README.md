# Flip-Flop Fusion: Integrating Analog and Digital Design for Flip-Flop Conversion

## Overview

This project focuses on converting an SR flip-flop into a JK flip-flop by integrating both analog and digital design techniques. The goal is to explore the traditional NAND gate-based implementation, CMOS-based design, and mixed-signal verification using Verilog, aiming to enhance the reliability and performance of digital circuits.


### Flip-Flops & Their Importance:
Flip-flops are fundamental sequential circuit elements that store binary data and are widely used in memory and logic systems. The SR flip-flop is a basic sequential circuit but has an invalid state when both the Set (S) and Reset (R) inputs are high, which is resolved in the JK flip-flop design.

### Motivation:
The project is motivated by the need to improve circuit reliability by transitioning from SR flip-flops to JK flip-flops while exploring the integration of analog and digital methodologies.
